In the course "JS Advanced" you will gain in-depth knowledge of JavaScript, such as syntax basics, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes and written functions. You will study more complex concepts such as functional context, explicit connection, cycle of events. The course will develop algorithmic higher thinking. After the successful completion of this course you will be able to work with the DOM tree, edit manipulations on it and work with "events". The functionality and OOP approaches to JavaScript programming will be considered, studying concepts such as inheritance, object composition and prototype circuit.
