The course "C # OOP" introduces us to the **principles of object-oriented programming (OOP)** to work with classes and objects, to use properly-oriented modeling and to build **hierarchies of classes**. The basic principles of OOP such as **abstraction** (interfaces, abstract classes), **encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism** are considered. You will find the most commonly used design templates (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns).I get acquainted with the **SOLID principles** for object-oriented software design. We consider different **debugging techniques**. We will learn how to create and use **decorators**. We will pay attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of **Test Driven Development** (TDD).
